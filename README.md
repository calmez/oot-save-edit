# OoT Save Edit

This project was started out of desperation when having accidentally deleting my
save file on an N64 play-through very late in the game. Researching my options I
found excellent sources that explained the binary format of the save file.

Also this work is based on AdmiralCurtiss' very helpful
https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss/OoTSaveEditor. My idea was to make it more
accessible to developers by rewriting this in Typescript. And it gave me a goo
excuse to try out Deno.
